# What's new about me?

- 27/11/22 ⮕ I just presented [my paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12664) in 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Vision and Computing [(ICIVC 2022)](https://www.icivc22.scrs.in). I had a wonderful time there, got to meet some amazing professors and experts in the field.

- 10/9/22 ⮕ Organised and hosted a workshop on Reinforcement Learning as the lead of [SMLRA](https://smlra-kjsce.github.io/#/). Find more on [my Teaching Tab](/teaching/).

- 25/8/22 ⮕ Completed my internship in [AdSkate](https://www.adskate.com/) under [Dr. Shreyas Venugopalan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m0otvlsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I worked on Multilingual Article Categorization, using Word embedding and Ensemble models. We tackled problems in NLP, Hierarchial Text Classification, Big Data Analysis and API Handling.

- 16/2/22 ⮕ Completed a certification from IIT-Madras on [Demystifying the Brain](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/102106066). Through this I was able to upskill myself in the area of computational neuroscience.

- 26/8/21 ⮕ My team was awarded as one of the three winners in [Google's Developer Student Clubs 2021 Solution Challenge](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge/winners) for our project [**Eye of God**](/projects/1_project/). This aim of the competition was to create a fully developed project that could create a positive impact on the community through the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
