<h3><b>Smartphone-Based Tactile Feedback System Providing Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance to the Blind and Visually Impaired</b></h3>

<strong>Accepted at 5th IEEE International Conference on Advances in Science & Technology 2022 <a href="https://sites.google.com/somaiya.edu/ieee-icast-2022/home?authuser=0">IEEE-ICAST-2022</a>.</strong>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> People with vision impairments and other visual disorders require support to complete daily tasks like moving around and discovering new places. They may find it difficult to navigate through a new place and could be put in danger if they run into unforeseen barriers or could get lost easily. This paper discusses a solution to aid the blind and visually impaired navigate independently while avoiding obstacles in their path. The system has two operational modes, Outdoor Navigation and Indoor Navigation, and it alerts the user through vibration (tactile) and audio feedback. While the Indoor mode accompanies a user to a labelled site, the Outdoor mode leads them to a geographical destination. The solution was able to reduce the Clearance time by 27.35 percent and the Obstacle hit rate by 66.6 percent. The system is hassle-free, comfortable to use and affordable because it requires only the user's smartphone and a custom-made hardware waist belt.

<h3><b>Feature-Rich Long-term Bitcoin Trading Assistant</b></h3>
<strong>Accepted at 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Vision and Computing <a href="https://www.icivc22.scrs.in">ICIVC 2022</a>.</strong>

<strong>Abstract:</strong> For a long time predicting, studying and analyzing financial indices has been of major interest for the financial community. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the Deep-Learning community to make use of reinforcement learning which has surpassed many of the previous benchmarks in a lot of fields. Our method provides a feature rich environment for the reinforcement learning agent to work on. The aim is to provide long term profits to the user so, we took into consideration the most reliable technical indicators. We have also developed a custom indicator which would provide better insights of the Bitcoin market to the user. The Bitcoin market follows the emotions and sentiments of the traders, so another element of our trading environment is the overall daily Sentiment Score of the market on Twitter. The agent is tested for a period of 685 days which also included the volatile period of Covid-19. It has been capable of providing reliable recommendations which give an average profit of about 69%. Finally, the agent is also capable of suggesting the optimal actions to the user through a website. Users on the website can also access the visualizations of the indicators to help fortify their decisions.
